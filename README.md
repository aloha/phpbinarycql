============

Php implementation of the CQL binary protocol.

Things that still need to be completed
--------------------------------------
- compression (snappy)
- collections (list, map and set)
- prepared queries

There is an example directory that contains a very short example of how to connect to Cassandra server and issue a query.

More documenation/examples to come.
